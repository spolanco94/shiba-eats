This is where I will be continuing my code practice from YelpCamp! I will continue to refactor this web application to include, but 
not limited to:
   - Redone landing page with a manual slideshow, with login and sign up buttons underneath
   - Working info tabs on show page
   - ~~Add comment boxes on show page as opposed to directing to a new page~~
   - ~~reCaptcha during signup~~ **DONE - ALSO ADDED TO LOGIN AND CONTACT PAGES**
   - ~~Password reset~~ **DONE**
   - ~~Add more rows to comment boxes~~ **DONE**
   - ~~Image upload~~ **DONE**
